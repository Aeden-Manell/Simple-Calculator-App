Instructions
Create a new HTML file and add the basic structure, including the <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body> elements.
Inside the <head> element, add a <title> element for the calculator app and link to an external CSS file for styling.
Inside the <body> element, create a form with input fields and buttons for the calculator. This should include:
Two input fields for the user to enter numbers (use the type="number" attribute for these input fields).
Four radio buttons, one for each arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
A "Calculate" button to trigger the calculation.
A "Reset" button to clear the input fields and reset the calculator.
An output field or element to display the result.
Add an external JavaScript file and link it in the HTML file.
In the JavaScript file, create functions for each arithmetic operation:
Addition: function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
Subtraction: function subtract(a, b) { return a - b; }
Multiplication: function multiply(a, b) { return a * b; }
Division: function divide(a, b) { return a / b; }
In the HTML file, add the onclick attribute to the "Calculate" button and call a function to perform the selected arithmetic operation. The function should:
Retrieve the values from the input fields.
Call the appropriate arithmetic function based on the selected operation.
Display the result in the output field or element.
Add the onclick attribute to the "Reset" button in the HTML file and call a function to clear the input fields and reset the calculator.
Style the calculator using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
Test the calculator app to ensure it works correctly and handles invalid input (e.g., divide by zero).
Feel free to explore the Calculator App and access the GitHub Repository for further details and code implementation.
